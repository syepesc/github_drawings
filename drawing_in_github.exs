  GitHub commit heatmap is represented with 7 rows as the days of the week,
  and columns for the weeks in a year. As follows:

  ```
              Jan xxxx ... n-month
              w1 w2 w3     wn
  Sunday      [] [] [] ... []
  Monday      [] [] [] ... []
  Tuesday     [] [] [] ... []
  Wednesday   [] [] [] ... []
  Thursday    [] [] [] ... []
  Friday      [] [] [] ... []
  Saturday    [] [] [] ... []
  ```

  Your drawing must be represented as a matrix of a list of lists. With the following rules:
    - `drawing`   - Must be a list of lists with 7 rows and each row must have the same length.
                    Each element of the matrix must be an integer between (including) 0 to 15.
                    Each value represent the number of commits per day.
                    The greater the value the darkest will look in the GitHub heatmap.
    - `init_date` - Must be a sunday that represents the top-left corner of the drawing.
    - `end_date`  - Must be a saturday that represents the bottom-right corner of the drawing.

  Ideally, you should draw in the past (not sure if you can in the future),
  so, make sure your GitHub history has some empty spaces.

  Since each value of a row is one week after the previous one,
  we can add the week to the initial date to get the current date.
  Then, we add the day to the current date to get the final date.

  init_date    +0 +7 +14 ... +7n
